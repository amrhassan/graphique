{"name":"Graphique","tagline":"Image Management Microservice","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amrhassan/graphique.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/amrhassan/graphique)\r\n\r\n# Graphique #\r\n\r\nAn image management [microservice](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) built using the awesomeness of Scala, [Akka](http://akka.io/), [Spray](http://spray.io/) and [Thumbnailator](https://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/).\r\n\r\nIt is built to handle:\r\n* the low level book keeping of storing the actual image files\r\n* the generation and caching of image variants in arbitrary sizes and formats\r\n* generating publicly-servable URLs for the managed images\r\n\r\nGraphique stores and hosts its own images over HTTP by default and it can use a different storage and file serving system like AWS S3, if configured to do so. It exposes its functionality through [RESTful APIs](https://github.com/amrhassan/graphique/wiki/API-Documentation).\r\n\r\n### Latest Release ###\r\nDownload the latest release [from here](https://github.com/amrhassan/graphique/releases/latest).\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\nThe associated `Makefile` can install the application by executing the `install` target directly:\r\n```\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running From Source ###\r\nTo run the service directly from its source code location, execute the following in the root of the source code tree:\r\n```\r\nsbt run\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\nGraphique uses the XDG BaseDirectory specification for looking up configuration files named `graphique/application.conf`. The configuration files are written in the [HOCON syntax](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md). You can override any of the specified config parameters from the internal [configuration file](/src/main/resources/application.conf).\r\n\r\n### Backends ###\r\nGraphique builds its functionality on top primitive operations provided by one of its Backend implementations. \r\n\r\n**The Local Backend**\r\n\r\nThis backend enables Graphique to store its images on the local filesystem and it \r\nspins up an internal http server to serve the requested images.\r\n\r\n**The AWS S3 Backend**\r\n\r\nThis backend enables Graphique to store its images on an S3 bucket as public files and delegate the image serving\r\nto S3.\r\n","google":"UA-5292165-16","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
